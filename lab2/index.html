    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>At its heart, HTML is a language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?), 
    structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page.</p>
    <P>Elements consist of:</P>
    <li>A tag name</li>
    <li>Required or optional attributes</li>
