        <h1>BCIT CIT Cohort</h1>
        <p>Many professors have advised us how crucial networking is especially in our own cohurts; BCIT also 
            surveyed recent graduates and their main concensus was that networking with your cohurt is cruicial.</p>
        <p>Moving forward, I think building a comradary with your own cohurt would be the best way to proceed through this diploma as 
            well as through our career paths later on in life. You may also make long lasting friendships as well which is even better than 
        just "work friends". BCIT's cohurt system is better than other post-secondary institutions, in my opinion. The same kind of comradary just
    isn't available when you attend several classes with different people every time. Sure you may have more network opportunities, but what are the chances of
those networks lasting in the long run. The relationships with cohurts have a higher chance of holding stronger bonds.</p>
